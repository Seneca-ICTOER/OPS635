### What This Course is About

This course teaches the maintenance, administration, and troubleshooting in an Linux virtualized environment. Students will learn to install configure, customize, test and maintain common services available on Linux servers. This course is the sixth in a series of courses about Linux technologies.

  - ULI101 taught you to be Linux user.
  - OPS235 taught you to move from being a Linux user to being a Linux system administrator.
  - OPS335 taught you to administer Linux servers (web servers, DNS servers, FTP servers, file sharing servers).
  - OPS435 taught you how to automate server administration tasks using scripting tools
  - OPS535 gave you an opportunity to put your Linux Sever administrator skills in action by integrating NFS, NIS, DNS, LDAP, HTTP, SMTP and networking services and provide solutions to real world problems.

In this course you will learn the tools needed to manage an Enterprise Network

### Learning by Doing

Most of the learning in this course occurs through the hands-on problem solving that takes place in doing labs and assignments. Therefore, it's very important to stay up-to-date with the coursework, and to practice until you have confidently mastered each task.

All of the software used in this course is _open source_ software, so you are free to use, modify, and redistribute it. This means that you can install it as many times as you want on as many different computers as you would like. It also means that you can tinker with it -- you can take it apart, see how it works, and put it back together in the same or a different way, limited only by your time and ambition. You are encouraged to experiment and question liberally.

## Tips and Suggestions

  - Always shut down your system under software control, rather than using the reset or power buttons. You can shutdown using the GUI or with the `poweroff`, `reboot`, `init`, or `shutdown` commands.

**Always shut down your virtual machines before shutting down your main system.**

If you do not shut down the virtual machines first, they may become unstable or unusable.
