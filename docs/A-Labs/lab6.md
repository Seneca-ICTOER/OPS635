# OpenShift Lab 6: Container Management Using OpenShift

## Overview

Deploying containerized services using a platform as a service (PaaS) tool can make it easier to manage having multiple services deployed across a larger number of machines.

**Pre-Requisites**

  - You must have accounts on github and quay.io. The process for obtaining both is outlined in the DO180 student guide available through the RedHat Academy Learning Platform.

**Materials**

  - One Solid State Drive (SSD), minimum capacity 240GB, in a USB3 Enclosure.

## Investigation 1: Preparing OpenShift

  - Complete the guided exercise at the end of chapter 1 in the DO180 student guide. It will link your OpenShift installation to your docker and quay.io accounts.

## Investigation 2: Deploying a containerized Service in OpenShift

  - Complete the lab at the end of chapter 6 in the DO180 student guide. Take a screenshot of you running the **lab openshift-review grade** command (showing you have passed all checks).

## Investigation 3: Deploying Multi-Container Services in OpenShift

  - Complete the lab at the end of chapter 7 in the DO180 student guide. Take a screenshot of you running the **lab multicontainer-review grade** command (showing you have passed all checks).
